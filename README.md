I hope this comes in handy for some people. I wanted to put everything you need in one place for 8T. All files have source.txt not README.md files anymore since Proton and Google don't support them like Nextcloud. They are there so you can verify everything I have uploaded and put in the repository is authentic.
I migrated everything to Google Drive but if you want privacy then use Proton. I try and sync everything to Proton, Nextcloud and Google once a day if I find updates. If any information on here isn't correct or you want something added just contact me (whyme1987@pm.me) and I will gladly correct it.
Ive decided to keep Nextcloud because i get the most downliads on it but im prolly going.to stop doing updates on googke because im having problems with googke deleting some of the filrs because theyre on a public link. i havnt decided yet.
